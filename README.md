# advanced-programming-concepts
A repository for code and projects from the Advanced Programming Concepts course at Southern Arkansas University (OOP with Java)

This code was written using the Eclipse IDE, and primarily run and tested through Eclipse. 

The first project is to build a simple GUI that allows a user to select from either the Employee or Manager categories and apply a "raise" to one or the other. (Traits.java, Manager.java, Employee.java, UserInterface.java, EmployeeUserInterface.java, ManagerUserInterface.java, and UserInterfaceDemo.java are the relevant files for the first project.)
