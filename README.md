# advanced-programming-concepts
A repository for code and projects from the Advanced Programming Concepts course at Southern Arkansas University (OOP with Java)

The first project is to build a simple GUI that allows a user to select from either the Employee or Manager categories and apply a "raise" to one or the other. (Traits.java, Manager.java, Employee.java, UserInterface.java, EmployeeUserInterface.java, ManagerUserInterface.java, and UserInterfaceDemo.java are the relevant files for the first project.)
