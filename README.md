# advanced-programming-concepts
A repository for code and projects from the Advanced Programming Concepts course at Southern Arkansas University (OOP with Java).

This code was written using the Eclipse IDE, and primarily run and tested through Eclipse. 

The goal of the first project (EmployeeManagerRaiseProject) was to build a simple GUI that allows a user to select from either the Employee or Manager categories and apply a "raise" to one or the other.

The goal of the second project (StudentGradesProject) was to ingest a group of student grades stored in a text file, and present them in a tabular GUI form while also producing a final grade for the student. The "students" for the course are famous NBA basketball players - the professor had a good sense of humor! 

Both projects required the use of both object-oriented and generic programming principles and techniques, such as class discovery, inheritance, polymorphism, and further provided the projects provided a good experience in managing a project under a deadline.
